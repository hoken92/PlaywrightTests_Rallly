## [Documentation](https://playwright.dev) | [API reference](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright)

Playwright is a framework for Web Testing and Automation. It allows testing [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and [WebKit](https://webkit.org/) with a single API. Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation that is **ever-green**, **capable**, **reliable** and **fast**.

Headless execution is supported for all browsers on all platforms. Check out [system requirements](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#system-requirements) for details.

## Installation

Following the command npm install will install Playwright and all other Rallly dependencies.

## üìÅ Structure

```sh
 |- playwright.config.ts # Configuration file
 |- test-results # Test recordings and failed test screenshots
 |- tests # Root directory for all my tests, locators
 |-- pages # Sets of pages for Rallly application
 |-- testCases # Here is the magic üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
```

## üìú What is Pages?

For the suite template I chose to follow the Page Objects pattern in order to encapsulate each pages internal structure and responsibilities inside its own highly cohesive class file.

That means that for each page I would define a new Page object for my needs. We should not confuse the Page objects, that create with actual pages in the application. We can think of Pages as a lightweight concept of a **view**, which is the set of cohesive elements living under a known browser location.

For more information on Page objects, read Playwright documentation [Doc](https://playwright.dev/docs/pom).

## üß∞ How to run playwright tests

After following Rallly's installation process in their [README](../README.md) and starting up the local server + docker. You can use multiple commands to start running the tests.

1. Running all tests, in headless mode on Chrome

```
npx npx playwright test
```

2. All current tests have a tag for smoke. Using the following command will run all tagged tests in head mode

```
npm run test:smoke
```

## :pencil2: Note:

- Configured in the playwright.config.ts is the timeout for each test step. It is currently configured to 10-20 seconds. I would suggest to increase it if it is the first time running the tests, since loading on local for nextJS is slow on loading the first time.
- The max runtime each test can take is 30 seconds. If a test exceeds the runtime, the test will exit automatically.

## ‚úÖ How to get Results

After the tests have completed, you can run the command below. This will open up the HTML report into your browser where you can view all test results. It'll also include a recording of the test flow the test cases went through.

If any failures occured, there will be a screenshot of the time the test failed.

```
npx playwright show-report
```

## üî® Improvements

1. Run the tests on CI with GitHub Actions
2. Implementing data-testids for more accurate element locators. It would hugely improve assertions and allow more flexibility on class locators to be used elsewhere.
3.

## üé¨ Blockers

1. My local couldn't set up the email verification messenger. It would never send out the 6 digit code, used to verify the email address. This ended up blocking test cases to register for any accounts and login flow.
